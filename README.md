# AI Chat Fold Extension

A Chrome extension to easily fold and unfold conversations in AI chat interfaces.

## Features

- **Fold/Unfold Single Answer:** Collapse or expand individual AI responses to focus on specific parts of the conversation.
- **Fold/Unfold All:** Quickly collapse or expand all AI responses in the current chat session with a single click.
- **Extensible Design:** Built with the flexibility to support multiple AI chat platforms.

## Supported Platforms

- ✅ DeepSeek
- ✅ Google AI Studio
- 🚧 ChatGPT (Planned)
- 🚧 Gemini (Planned)
- And more...

## Design & Usage

The extension will inject control buttons directly into the chat interface for an intuitive user experience:
- A fold/unfold button will appear next to each AI-generated answer.
- A "Fold All" / "Unfold All" button will be placed in a convenient, non-intrusive location on the page (e.g., near the main chat controls).

This approach is preferred over a separate popup window to provide a more seamless and integrated feel.
